# Portalable-OCR
My First ever project, more of a proof of concept than an actual tool to use. still working on improving it and this is just to keep a record. DO NOT USE IF YOU WANT GREAT RESULTS.
i made an executive app for windows using py-installer while adding the data of both poppler and tesseract into the app.

Updates that i want but scrapped for this version:
1) more accurate Text extraction ie bullets, spaces, fonts etc
2) Tables extraction
3) the ability to save tables into a csv file.
4) better Gui and quicker results
5) Image enhancments
the app works for both english and arabic pdf or image as long as you specify with the button.
